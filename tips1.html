      <div align="Left">Okay, let's define what we're talking about here. 
   &nbsp;Burnouts done on a motorcycle, no feet on the ground. &nbsp;I'm assuming
   you can already do a burnout, so we'll skip the basics of getting the
front   tire to stick to the road whilst the rear tire spins madly. &nbsp;We'll
 just  cover the really good stuff-- &nbsp;how to directionally control that
 fishtailing  bike you're on. <br>
      <br>
      First things first-- &nbsp;spinning the rear tire is what gives the 
back   of the bike some lateral freedom. &nbsp;When it's not spinning at all,
you   can apply a large side load to the bike and there is no drift at all.
&nbsp;But   when the rear tire is spinning at some velocity relative to the
road surface,   any side loads the bike experiences will cause some amount
of rear wheel  drift. &nbsp;The faster the tire spins, the slicker the tire
and road, and  the larger the side load on the bike, the greater the drift
velocity will  be. &nbsp;<br>
      <br>
      &nbsp;So, what side loads (forces) are there on the bike? &nbsp;<br>
      <ol>
        <li>Gravity-- &nbsp;the rear always wants to drift downhill. &nbsp;</li>
        <li>Turning forces-- &nbsp;The rear always wants to drift to the
   outside of the turn. &nbsp;</li>
      </ol>
      <br>
      Of course, these two can be in the same direction or in opposite directions.
         <br>
      <br>
      For lotsa' smoke-- &nbsp;spin the tire really fast (I use 3rd gear
when   possible), make sure you're not on any kind of a sidehill (point the
bike   uphill if possible, then the pendulum effect works for you), and aim
the  bike in a straight line by using just enough forward velocity to keep
the  bike under control. &nbsp;<br>
      <br>
      For figure 8's and stuff, spin the tire at a much slower rate and use 
 the  information in the following table to obtain the drift rate you desire.
